# Icon for Taupe

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/icon/bird-233023/) of a bird, used as the icon for this repository, was created by [Noe Araujo](https://thenounproject.com/noearaujo/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS, to change the icon color to [taupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taupe).
